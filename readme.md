# Synthwave_Angel Unity Project

Hello, I am Miarley.

This is the code section of my first Unity project - "Synthwave_Angel."

The development of this project has spanned over half a year. During this time, I have been researching online and iteratively evolving this game.

There is still a lot of room for improvement in the current codebase of this project, and I will continue to strive for continuous optimization.

Thank you for visiting!
